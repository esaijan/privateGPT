# privateGPT
Ask questions to your documents without an internet connection, using the power of LLMs. 100% private, no data leaves your execution environment at any point. You can ingest documents and ask questions without an internet connection!

Forked from [privateGPT repo](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT). Refer to repo README for more information

Built with [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all), [LlamaCpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) and [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/).

# Environment Setup
In order to set your environment up to run the code here, first clone and then:

1. Run `poetry shell` or `source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate` to activate virtual env

2. Download the LLM model and place it in a directory of your choice:
- LLM: default to [ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin](https://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin). If you prefer a different GPT4All-J compatible model, just download it and reference it in your `.env` file.

3. Copy the `example.env` template into `.env`
```shell
cp example.env .env
```

and edit the variables appropriately in the `.env` file.
```
MODEL_TYPE: supports LlamaCpp or GPT4All
PERSIST_DIRECTORY: is the folder you want your vectorstore in
MODEL_PATH: Path to your GPT4All or LlamaCpp supported LLM
MODEL_N_CTX: Maximum token limit for the LLM model
MODEL_N_BATCH: Number of tokens in the prompt that are fed into the model at a time. Optimal value differs a lot depending on the model (8 works well for GPT4All, and 1024 is better for LlamaCpp)
EMBEDDINGS_MODEL_NAME: SentenceTransformers embeddings model name (see https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html)
TARGET_SOURCE_CHUNKS: The amount of chunks (sources) that will be used to answer a question
```

Note: because of the way `langchain` loads the `SentenceTransformers` embeddings, the first time you run the script it will require internet connection to download the embeddings model itself.

4. Run `poetry install` to install all the dependencies 
5. Run `poetry run python extract.py` - which gets top 50 files and downloads only the content into .txt files under `source_documents/`
6. Run `poetry run python ingest.py` - to ingest all the data into the LLM

It will create a `db` folder containing the local vectorstore. Will take 20-30 seconds per document, depending on the size of the document.
You can ingest as many documents as you want, and all will be accumulated in the local embeddings database.
If you want to start from an empty database, delete the `db` folder.

Note: during the ingest process no data leaves your local environment. You could ingest without an internet connection, except for the first time you run the ingest script, when the embeddings model is downloaded.

7. In order to ask a question and set up a GPT instance, run:

```shell
poetry run python privateGPT.py
```

And wait for the script to require your input.

```plaintext
> Enter a query:
```

Hit enter. You'll need to wait 20-30 seconds (depending on your machine) while the LLM model consumes the prompt and prepares the answer. Once done, it will print the answer and the 4 sources it used as context from your documents; you can then ask another question without re-running the script, just wait for the prompt again.

Note: you could turn off your internet connection, and the script inference would still work. No data gets out of your local environment.

Type `exit` to finish the script.

8. Type `deactivate` to exit out of the venv


### CLI
The script also supports optional command-line arguments to modify its behavior. You can see a full list of these arguments by running the command ```python privateGPT.py --help``` in your terminal.


# System Requirements

## Python Version
To use this software, you must have Python 3.10 or later installed. Earlier versions of Python will not compile.
